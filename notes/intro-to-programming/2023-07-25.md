#### What we did
- return to angular
- introduction to Redux

#### Notes
- semantic versioning- versions come in 3 parts
	- Major- for breaking changes
	- Minor- includes backward compatible new features
	- Patch- incremented for backward compatible bug fixes
- state management
	- flux architecture
		- component own no data
		- all data is stored in a *global* immutable object
practice exercise- make counter reset to initial state (current=0)
