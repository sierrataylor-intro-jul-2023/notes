#### What we're doing today
- CORS
- environments-
	- dev/prod
	- building
- API design
- make a list of "missing features"- create your own homework
- containers
	- defining and building
	- containerizing our app and APIs
- calling one API from another
#### Notes
- to create a new environment in an Angular app- `ng generate environments`
HTTP-based APIs
- hypertext transfer protocol- application-level protocol for information systems; used to transfer knowledge
- terms
	- resources
		- identified by the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
		- example httpss://api.hypertheory.com/todo-list?status-waiting
		- -https://- the protocol
		- supported method
			- GET- return a representation of this thing (safe, idempotent, cacheable)
			- POST- add this as a subordinate resource (unsafe, non-idempotent, non-cacheable)
			- PUT- replace one resources with a new representation (unsafe, idempotent, non-cacheable )
			- DELETE- remove this resource (unsafe, non-idempotent, non-cacheable)
		- *properties of supported methods* 
			- safe- nothing about the business is changed by the method
			- idempotent- doing it multiple times is the same as doing it once
			- cacheable
