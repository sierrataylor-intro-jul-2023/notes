#### What we did
- start off with APIs, specifically profiling and middleware
	- make API controller and model for todo list in visual studio
- getting started with [[containers and Kubernetes]]
	- write `docker-compose.yml` file, composed up container in Docker and hook container a database
- 
- review some testing stuff
	- exceptions
	- mocking
	- comparing different kinds of testing
	- angular testing
- writing/reading documentation
- getting started with [[databases]] 
- command line
	- CMD (DOS)
	- PowerShell (cross-platform, designed by Microsoft)
	- Bash/Zsh

#### Notes
- GitHub Desktop- a graphic user interface that allows you to perform git operations
- **git vs. GitHub** 
	- git- distributed version control (devs pull from and push to an origin)
		- centralized version control- there's a large server somewhere that owns the code and developers (with access) log in to make changes to code in the repository
		- distributed version control- the code has an "origin" repository and developers can clone the code onto their local machines, make changes, and then push the changes to
	- GitHub- a platform to host git repositories
- some teams prefer Azure DevOps because it is more enterprise-friendly and can be used to store code internally without
- **integration**: how services talk to each other
- JSON documents:
	- can contain numbers, strings, arrays, Booleans, characters, objects, null values
- **QUESTION FOR TOMORROW: WILL WE EVER NEED TO CREATE SEPARATE BRANCHES FOR THIS PROJECT?**
