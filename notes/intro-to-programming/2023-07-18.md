#### What we did today

#### Notes
- more work in [[Angular]] 
- many Flash applications are designed for web-based applications, not touch-based
- continuous integration- part of DevOps; continually integrating- ==every day you want to make at **least one commit**== 
	- pipelines- 
		- can we build it? 
		- testing- unit test, security compliance, etc.
	- delivery- delivering a container image to a registry that could be used in production
- behavior-driven development: describing the behavior of a system/application in different modes; created by Dan North
- developer testing vs. traditional software testing
	- developer testing- writing tests for code that doesn't exist yet and using them to verify the code we're writing as we go
- DevOps feedback loops- come from Cybernetics
	- inner loops- everything that happens on your machine during development
	- outer loops- everything after (pushing it to the repo, etc.)
- timeline- you develop the code, testers point out that it broke something and send it back, then you send it back for testing, and so on
- test during development **as much as possible**
- continuous deployment- making changes in smaller increments
- hypothesis-driven development- try to hypothesize about what the customer wants when writing test
