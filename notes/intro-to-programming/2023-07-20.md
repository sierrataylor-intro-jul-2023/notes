#### What we did
- use test-driven development to create a library
- start working on bank account library using test-driven development
	- creating an data type called BankAccount and defining its properties, methods, etc.
	- more unit tests
- tomorrow afternoon we will be in groups and making new projects

#### Notes
- the issue with the Waterfall method of design is that while something sounds good in design, it may be difficult to implement in development
- 
- modes of testing-
	- end to end testing
	- contract/acceptance/isolated integration testing
	- unit testing
- object-oriented programming
	- procedural programming- decisions, loops, variables
	- SABRE- flight reservation and tracking
	- you have data (the state) and code that works on that data (the behavior)
		- OOP says let's relate those two together in a kind of capsule
		- ==**classes** define two things an object can have: **data** (state- current value of data) and **behavior** (methods, properties, constructors)== 
			- *data* (state) is class level variables- "fields"; almost always encapsulated as private
			- *behavior* is usually public things that alter the state
	- **cohesion**: making sure that the behaviors of a type are related to the data of that type; e.g. a string in .NET knows how to do string stuff (convert to integer, lowercase, etc.)
- ==the only documentation you should trust is the tests; **write tests to also act as documentation**==
