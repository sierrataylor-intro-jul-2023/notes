#### What we did
- quick review
	- creating a user-facing application
	- SOA/ microservices
- .NET
- test-first development: writing intentional code by starting with a meaningfully failing test,  writing the simplest code that gets the test to pass, then make the code better as you gain insight to the problem
	- a lot of time as a developer is spent refactoring code that works
	- "Code Smells"- recognizing issue in code without having to go through a lot of it
	- Martin Fowler- "Improving the design of existing code"
	- bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code
#### Notes
- using visual studio enterprise
- using [[dotnet]] 
- David Fowler and Damien Edwards- worked at Microsoft; worked on an open-source project that 
- common language runtime (CLR), which is a program that has to be installed on the machine for your .NET application to run
	- framework class library- all the .NET types that come in the "box"
	- System.Console
	- common intermediate language (CIL)- similar to Java bytecode; .NET code is 
systems programming- creating operating systems, database engines, compilers, tools
- languages often used- ASM, C, C++, Rust
- priorities
	- reliability- making sure the system works for everyone
	- performance- considering Big o notation, performance profiling, array vs. list
library or framework programming-
- library: code your code uses; "helpers"
- framework: code that uses your code; heavier than libraries; 
- reliability: be more general
four rules of simple design
	- passes the test-it works
	- reveal intention- can you understand what the code was created for?
	- no duplication- don't repeat yourself
	- fewest elements- variables, loops, etc.
- heartbleed- a bug often found in outdated versions of OpenSSL that made most of the Internet insecure- caused by a missing curly bracket pair in a switch statement
