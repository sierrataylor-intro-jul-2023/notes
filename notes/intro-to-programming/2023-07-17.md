#### What we did
- we got into our VMs
- we created multi-desktops
	- keyboard shortcut to go back and forth is `Windows+Ctrl+Right arrow` & `Window+Ctrl+Left arrow` 
- created folder for full stack application and pushed project to GitHub organization
- worked on Angular typescript code
- created an angular application
- installed tailwind CSS
#### Notes
- react is good for creating a personalized experience for different users; but ==angular is better for a more consistent UI==
	- instantly responsive
	- no need to rerun an entire application every time something is changes
	- does not send a ton of request or content to the server
- it is ==for creating applications that run in a web browser==, **not for creating website**
- Angular applications
	- angular CLI- `npm i --g @angular/cli`
	- to create new standalone angular app- `ng new app --standalone --skip-git --skip-tests`
	- to run and open an application- `ng serve -o` - the -o tag tell the server to open what it is running
- the Progressive website is not an angular application, but a server-side application
	- it give the end-user feedback
- npm start vs ng serve- ng serve is its own command, npm start is just a script in the json config file which will run ng serve
